Confidential computing is a relatively new technology that is gaining traction in the software development industry. It is a cloud computing technology that isolates sensitive data in a protected CPU enclave during processing, eliminating the remaining data security vulnerability by protecting data in use. This technology is essential for secure source code reviews, as it allows for the secure storage and analysis of source code without the risk of exposing intellectual property.

Confidential computing is especially useful for source code reviews conducted by third-party auditors. It allows the auditor to access the source code without revealing any confidential information, while still providing the necessary data for the review. This is especially important for companies that operate in multiple jurisdictions, as it allows them to maintain trust across different countries and regulations.

Confidential computing also allows for the use of automated software analysis tools, which can be used to detect vulnerabilities and compliance issues in the source code. This is especially useful for companies that have large codebases, as it allows them to quickly and accurately identify any potential issues. Additionally, confidential computing can be used to securely store and analyze the output from these tools, ensuring that any confidential information is not exposed.

Overall, confidential computing is an essential technology for secure source code reviews. It allows for the secure...
