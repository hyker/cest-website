Navigating source code security is an important part of understanding the risks of state-sponsored intrusions. Source code is the foundation of any software system, and it is essential to ensure that it is secure and free from vulnerabilities. To do this, organizations must use a combination of static and dynamic analysis tools to scan the code for potential security issues. Static analysis tools examine the source code for coding errors, while dynamic analysis tools look for vulnerabilities in the code at runtime.

In addition to these tools, organizations should also consider using software assurance frameworks such as GSMA NESAS and 3GPP SCAS. These frameworks provide guidance on how to assess the security of software and provide a set of security requirements that must be met. They also provide guidance on how to conduct source code reviews and source code governance. NESAS focuses on the governance of the product development and lifecycle processes, while SECAM provides a methodology for conducting security assurance and a catalogue of generic security requirements.

Organizations should also consider using SARIF, the Static Analysis Results Interchange Format, to aggregate the output from different tools and view the results in a standardized format. This makes it easier to calculate metrics on the code quality and protect elements in the outcome of the tools. Finally, organizations...
