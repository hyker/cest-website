If you are looking for a tool to detect coding errors, then a dynamic analysis tool may be the best choice. Additionally, if you are looking for a tool to analyze code metrics or hundreds of additional classes of bugs, then an automated tool for static analysis of binaries may be the best choice.

Second, it is important to consider the language that the software is written in. Different tools may be better suited for different languages, so it is important to make sure that the tool you choose is compatible with the language you are using.

Third, it is important to consider the level of automation that the tool provides. Some tools may require manual intervention, while others may be able to automatically detect and report on potential issues.
