Third-party code auditing is an important part of software assurance, as it helps to ensure that the code is secure and trustworthy. However, when source code is not available, it can be difficult to conduct a thorough audit. This is especially true when the code is developed by a third-party, as the code may contain intellectual property that the third-party does not want to reveal. In this blog post, we will discuss some of the challenges associated with third-party code auditing without source code access, and provide some insider perspectives on how to overcome these challenges.

One of the biggest challenges associated with third-party code auditing without source code access is the lack of visibility into the code. Without access to the source code, it is difficult to identify potential vulnerabilities and security flaws. Additionally, it is difficult to assess the quality of the code and ensure that it meets the necessary standards. To overcome this challenge, it is important to use a combination of static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential issues. Additionally, it is important to use trusted third-party auditors who have experience in code auditing and can provide an independent assessment of the code.
