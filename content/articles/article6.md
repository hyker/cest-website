Software security analysis tools are essential for ensuring the safety and security of software applications. However, it can be difficult to understand the different types of tools available and how they work. This blog post aims to demystify transparency in software security analysis tools and provide the facts you need to make an informed decision.

The first step in understanding software security analysis tools is to understand the two main types of tools: white-box and black-box. White-box tools are used to analyze source code and detect coding errors, insecure coding constructs, and other indicators of security vulnerabilities or weaknesses. Black-box tools are used to analyze an executing program without knowledge of the program's internals. These tools are used to simulate possible attack vectors or abnormal use of the software.

The SAMATE project has produced a classification and taxonomy of software assurance tools. These tools are not strictly limited to security testing tools; they also encompass general software testing tools which can be applied to software vulnerability detection or security property verification. The classification is based on where in life cycle process the tool is used, the level of automation, analysis approach, and what type of access to the software the tool has. Open source tools such as FlawFinder, Rcode metrics...
