#Introduction
## Purpose A
The purpose of the CEST project was to research and develop novel technologies, processes, and methodologies that enables security analysis of proprietary sensitive software, while preserving confidentiality. The trust in third-party software, enforced by the CEST approach, can accelerate the secure digitalization of industries and critical societal services, as software is at the center of many companies' digitization efforts. The we provide a prototype(ADD_LINK_TO_SOLUTION_LATER) of the proposed system to demonstrate the feasibility and market potential. 

## Purpose B
The CEST project was conducted by a consortium of project partners, including atsec information security AB, Ericsson AB, Hyker Security, and RISE Cybersecurity. atsec was responsible for leading the security assurance tracks, while Ericsson Research, Security Area coordinated the project and provided strategic direction. Hyker provided expertise in confidential computing technologies, while RISE provided expertise in trusted execution and PhD candidate support. 

The main deliverable of the CEST project was a proof of concept prototype environment comprising a confidential computing environment platform specifically designed for confidential evaluation of software trustworthiness (CEST), confidentiality-aware software analysis tools, and representative CEST test use cases for the Telco industry domain. In addition to the CEST platform, the project also produced supporting documents such as methodologies for security software assurance, suggestions for standardization in domain-specific specifications, and a demonstrator illustrating the feasibility of the proposed architecture. 

The goals of the CEST project were to conduct a complete risk analysis of a novel trust model where the security evaluation of sensitive software is conducted by independent third parties, investigate suitable confidential computing technologies as enablers for the CEST platform, and investigate how to adapt state of the art software analysis tools for use in a confidential

##Goal
The goal of the CEST project was to conduct a complete risk analysis of a novel trust model where the security evaluation of sensitive software is conducted by independent third parties. The project also aimed to investigate suitable confidential computing technologies as enablers for the CEST platform, as well as to adapt state of the art software analysis tools for use in a confidential computing environment. Additionally, the project aimed to help the Swedish Tech industry as well as the traditional industry to move faster into handle a secured software-based sustainable environment. Hyker, the project partner, was given the possibility to take a great position and become an important player in the Cyber Security assurance market and value chain, both in Sweden as well as in the international arena. The project also aimed to exploit the results to bring cybersecurity to a larger group of industry and public sector in Sweden, as well as to disseminate the results to a wider audience in top scientific conferences and journals.

##Participants
The CEST project was a collaborative effort between atsec information security AB, Ericsson AB, and Hyker Security. atsec information security AB is a vendor independent company specialized in IT security evaluations and assessments. Ericsson AB is a Swedish company in the Ericsson Group – one of the leading providers of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to service providers. Hyker Security is a Swedish majority owned spin-out from Saab Ventures. atsec, Ericsson, and Hyker each contributed to the project in different ways. atsec was responsible for leading the security assurance tracks, conducting the studies that specified the assurance environment to be constructed, defining the test use cases and their execution. Ericsson Research, Security Area coordinated the project and disseminated the results to stakeholders. Hyker contributed to the project by providing its technical platform, True Full Lifecycle Encryption (TFLE), which is enabled by its unique technology and can be built into IoT solutions, Web applications, and other solutions where trust and integrity is of importance in a cloud environment. Hyker’s technical platform has attracted a lot of attention in the last twelve months due to the pandemic and digitalization in combination with securing data in transit or at rest.

#Challanges
The CEST project addressed the challenge of establishing software trustworthiness while preserving the confidentiality of proprietary sensitive software. As software-defined architectures and networks are being increasingly used in ICT critical infrastructures, regulators and services providers are demanding independent evidence of trustworthiness. However, during the independent software security evaluation process, the sensitive software code base is exposed to auditors, potentially compromising important proprietary information including highly sensitive intellectual property (IPR). This could result in a disadvantage for Swedish companies in some markets.
The proposed solution was to develop a confidential computing environment platform specifically designed for confidential evaluation of software trustworthiness (CEST). This platform would enable the collection of enough evidence of trustworthiness without revealing IPR. The project was a collaborative effort between atsec information security, Hyker, and RISE, and was designed to help the Swedish Tech industry as well as the traditional industry to move faster into handle a secured software-based sustainable environment. Hyker will via this project be given the possibility to take a great position and become an important player in the Cyber Security assurance market and value chain, both in Sweden as well as in the international arena. RISE Cybersecurity, the research and technology partner in CEST, is at the forefront of the cybersecurity research

#Solution A
The proposed solution for the CEST project involves the use of confidential computing technologies, software analysis tools, and hybrid cryptosystems and standards. The confidential computing technologies will be used to create a secure environment for the evaluation of sensitive software, while the software analysis tools will be used to detect potential vulnerabilities in the software. The hybrid cryptosystems and standards will be used to ensure the confidentiality of the software during transit and storage. The CEST platform will also include processes for packaging, transit, rest, evaluation, and exposure, which will ensure the security of the software throughout the assurance lifecycle. Additionally, the project will be led by Mr. Jonas Hallin, founder of Hyker and CTO, Cybersecurity specialist, and Mr. Ulf Gerold, CEO of Hyker, who will be leading the commercialization and exploitation of the results for the Swedish industry benefit. RISE Cybersecurity, the research and technology partner in CEST, will be responsible for the overall system architecture, research on assurance platform, and the testing of the implemented platform. The project will last 2 years, divided into four work packages and tasks, and will develop RISE R&D know-how, specifications/software components, and scientific publications as project results.

#Solution B
The CEST platform will be based on confidential computing technologies, such as Intel SGX and open enclaves, and will include confidentiality-aware software analysis tools. The platform will also include methodologies for security software assurance and suggestions for standardization in domain-specific specifications. The project will also provide representative CEST test use cases for the Telco industry domain, including selected representative network functions implemented as software-defined systems. The project is coordinated by RISE Cybersecurity, the research and technology partner in CEST, and is led by the Principal Investigator (PI) from RISE, Shahid Raza, and the co-PI from RISE, Arash Vahidi. Anum Khurshid, a PhD candidate and trusted execution researcher, is also involved in the implementation of the proposed solution

#Goals
The goal of the CEST project is to develop a prototype that can evaluate software and executables using a zero-trust assurance model. The prototype will contain two user roles: Evaluator and Vendor. The prototype will be tested and evaluated using open-source 4G and 5G projects as potential TOEs (Target of Evaluation). The evaluation process and evaluation results will come from the tools listed in the CEST User Manual. The evaluation results will be compared with evaluation results from the same tools installed in a Linux environment. The CEST prototype will be tested and evaluated on the following aspects: analysis results, performance, usability, protection of intellectual property, and potential improvements from an assurance perspective. Additionally, the prototype will be tested to verify that all functions available as a user, in both roles, are working as expected. This includes the login/logout process and credentials selection, uploading a TOE (both executable and source code), starting evaluations using one and several tools, setting custom parameters on Evaluation policy, deletion of an evaluation from the GUI, uploading different sized TOEs, viewing evaluation progress, report viewing, report redaction, downloading report pre- & post-redaction, remote attestation, verification of report integrity pre-redaction
