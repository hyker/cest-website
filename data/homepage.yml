  title: "Introduction"
  desc2: "The CEST project was established to address the challenge of finding a solution that would allow confidential software security analysis without exposing the evaluated software itself, and still providing software analysis reports for assurance purposes."
  desc1: "Several countries and standards are putting forward security assurance regulations on ICT supply chains, on vendors, and on service providers to ensure the trustworthiness of their products and services. Many of the requirements require high transparency towards 3 rd party authorized auditors and evaluators. Certainly, the more evidence about how products are developed, the better assurance can be conducted. But, on the other hand, wider and deeper insight into vendors’ processes and products increases the risk of compromising the intellectual property contained in leading-edge proprietary software technologies, enterprise product life-cycle management processes, and know-how."

    text: "Hyker Security is a Swedish majority owned spin-out from Saab Ventures.
Hyker’s approach to cybersecurity is in protecting data rather than
infrastructure over the whole lifecycle. Therefore, Hyker has engineered a
platform, True Full Lifecycle Encryption (TFLE), that is enabled by our unique
technology which can be built into IoT solutions, Web applications and
other solutions where trust and integrity is of importance in a cloud
environment. Hyker’s technical platform has attracted a lot of attention in the
last twelve months due to the pandemic and digitalization in combination with
securing data in transit or at rest."
