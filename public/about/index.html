    <h1 class="text-center">About</h1>
    <h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<h3 id="softwarization">Softwarization</h3>
<p>Software-Defined architectures are being increasingly used in ICT-based critical infrastructures which has impacted traditional product development processes, standardization specifications, assurance processes and regulations. For instance, in the Telecommunications sector, the 3GPP specification have completely re-designed the mobile network by architecting a software-based mobile core network called Service-Based Architecture (SBA).,</p>
<h3 id="regulations-amp-standards">Regulations &amp; Standards</h3>
<p>Several countries and standards are putting forward security assurance regulations on ICT supply chains, on vendors, and on service providers to ensure the trustworthiness of their products and services. Many of the requirements require high transparency towards 3 rd party authorized auditors and evaluators. Certainly, the more evidence about how products are developed, the better assurance can be conducted. But, on the other hand, wider and deeper insight into vendorsâ€™ processes and products increases the risk of compromising the intellectual property contained in leading-edge proprietary software technologies, enterprise product life-cycle management processes, and know-how.</p>
<h2 id="security-assurance-and-certification">Security Assurance and Certification</h2>
<h3 id="technologies">Technologies</h3>
<p>Software analysis tools are now incorporating AI/ML technologies to detect bad coding practices, vulnerabilities, or hidden backdoors. Even though this is field is at early research stages the trend is clear that AI-based software analysis tools will be able to automate the analysis process providing valuable analysis reports.</p>
<p>Confidential computing technologies have been evolving</p>
<h3 id="challenge">Challenge</h3>
<p>For software vendors and suppliers in the software supply chain, the regulated transparency creates a dilemma between being compliant accepting risk or being non-compliant losing market shares.</p>
<p>The CEST project was established to address the challenge of finding a solution that would allow confidential software security analysis without exposing the evaluated software itself, and still providing software analysis reports for assurance purposes.</p>
